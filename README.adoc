=== Abstract:

[.text-justify]
This repository includes files for ElmerGrid which is a mesh generation utility for the Elmer project. ElmerGrid can create simple structured 2D meshes consisting
of quadrilaterals or triangles. Also limited 3D functionality is provided in terms of extruded 2D meshes resulting to hexahedrons or prisms. The program may also be used as a mesh import and export utility. It is able to read several different formats (Gmsh, UNIVERSAL file format, COMSOL `mphtxt` files,..) and writes mainly Elmer input and output formats, and also VTK format. The meshes may also be given some simple operations such as scaling, rotation, cloning, extrusion ect. ElmerGrid includes also partitioning capabilities of Elmer meshes. The partitioning may be done using internal geometric division or Metis library. `ElmerGridManual.pdf` can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/elmerfem/files/ElmerDocumentation/[here].
